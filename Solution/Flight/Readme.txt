My application describes the process of registering a new passenger at the airport, passing a check-in, security check and passport control.

First, a database of all passengers is created.
Then we register a new passenger, fill in the personal information.
Next, the passenger proceed to the check-in, where it is checked whether he has passed pre-registration.
If he did, then he must show the ticket. If it didn’t pass, then his ticket is printed at the reception.
Then the passenger, if necessary, registers the baggage and receives a baggage tag and boarding pass.
Next, the passenger follows to check for security check and passport control.
If all is well, the passenger board the plane.
All its data is stored in the airport database.
